# SQL_for_Data_Science


This repository contains my own solutions to the weekly code assignments and a project work on Yelp dataset that is completed in order to acquire an official certificate through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). The [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science?) is offered by the University of California - Davis. Make sure to check out the ER diagrams of both the weekly code assignments and project work before examining my solutions. As a relational database management system (RDMBS) I have made use of the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).
